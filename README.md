# DE2Bot Project
*Autonomous robot navigation project using the DE2 FPGA platform for ECE 2031 Fall 2018.*

The objective of this project was to implement autonomous navigation on the DE2Bot platform, which is an
AmigoBot outfitted with a DE2 FPGA board. This was achieved by writing SCASM assembly code that runs on
a VHDL-based computer.

The project postmortem report can be found [here](Project%20Report.pdf).

The `src` directory contains the Quartus II project files. The relevant assembly code can be found in [`Main.asm`](src/Main.asm).
